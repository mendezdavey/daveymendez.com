    <p>
        Learning guitar can be a great way to express your self to the world. Music is very powerful
        and more so when it has a powerful message channelling through the melody. The reason why I think
        music is powerful is because you make people more open to new ideas through song. However,
        I don't advocate the use of music to control the hearts and minds of a population.
        Music should be used to express a positive message and make the world a better place.

    <h2>Things that will make you a good guitar player:</h2>

        <li>Practice what you like.</li>
        <li>Create a band</li>
        <li>Dont forget to enjoy it</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dont forget to enjoy it.</h2>
    <p>
        If you don't like playing guitar and having people here you, move one to something else. There is
        plenty of things to do that can make you happy and others around you.
