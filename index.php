    <h1>Welcome to my Home Page</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my site! The purpose for this is to help people learn practical skills that they can
        apply in their daily lives. I believe that people are naturally creative but are not
        because of lack of motivation. If everyone decided to stop watching TV, Play Video Games, and all other
        unnecessary distractions, they would make life more meaningful. I believe that there is
        allot of hidden potential in people and hope that they unleash it.

    <h2>Guitar Tutorials</h2>
    <p>
        I have been playing guitar for about 7 years and enjoy teaching it just as much.
        I started playing guitar when I was 17 years because I decided that being a Guitar
        Player is more productive than a PC Gamer. PC Gaming is not bad but in reality it is
        a complete waste of your time. There is a biblical proverb that says: That if you work
        with a slack hand you will not prosper. In other words, if you want to prosper at playing guitar
        then limit all other unnecessary distractions and work hard. I play PC games every once in a
        while but limited to 30 minutes to an hour.

    <h2>Web Server</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first time that I host my site on my very own web server and am very thrilled to have
        accomplished what seems like a milestone in my pursuit for knowledge. This is a very important thing to
        have because your very own web page and server allows you to post anything you want free from sensorship.
        However, with any power comes the responsibility that you use it for the greater good.
    </p>

    <h2>Jesus Saves</h2>
    <p>
        One of the reasons that I believe in Jesus is because I believe that his teachings and discipline
        can save one from the evils of this world. For example, Jesus taught that we should love our neighbors as
        our selves. I also believe that he is the way the truth and the life and no one will see the Father if it is
        not through him.
